# WDIO6_Docker

This is a sample script to run WebdriverIO Automation scripts in docker.
I have added the compose file and the package.json 
You can clone this repository and do an npm install to get going.

Pre-requirements
- Docker client should be installed on your machine
- node.js v12.16.1 or greater

You can watch a video of how we can use docker to run automation scripts in the below link.

Thank you
